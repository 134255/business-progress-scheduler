# Current Status

Status captured: 2026-08-06 (Asia/Shanghai)

## Verified state

- Feature branch `codex/account-admin` implements the account-administration milestone through Task 6 of `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-05-account-admin.md` at `345a972`; formal-review round-one fixes are currently uncommitted controller-owned worktree changes pending re-review.
- Implemented: password hashing, account/password authentication, first-login password change, lockout, emergency initialization/recovery, super-administrator user lifecycle, last-active-admin protection, CloudBase repositories, protected routes, deterministic WeChat identity reservations, and audit-safe logging.
- Mini Program account flow now includes silent account service calls with preserved backend error codes, session restoration, initialization gating, memory-only first-login challenge handoff, forced and normal password change, app-owned auth reset, and a dashboard guard without legacy profile bootstrapping.
- The Mini Program now includes protected super-administrator user listing, creation, editing, status changes, password reset, unlock, WeChat unbind, last-active-administrator messaging, gated dashboard entry, and profile password/logout controls. Password values stay out of global state, storage, datasets, and navigation parameters.
- CloudBase account state uses a singleton `system_settings/account_admin_state` guard so all active-super-admin transitions contend on one document.
- WeChat identity uniqueness uses `wechat_bindings/<sha256(openid)>`; it does not rely on an unsupported sparse unique `users.openid` index.
- Credential mutations use monotonic `credentialVersion`; challenge invalidation uses strict monotonic `challengeEpoch`. Both fail closed on corrupt or overflowing state.
- `wx-server-sdk` is pinned and locked at `4.0.2`.

## Blockers

- `npm audit` reports six transitive findings (one moderate, five high) through the official `wx-server-sdk@4.0.2` dependency tree. npm proposes a major downgrade to 2.5.3; it was not applied because it would invalidate the reviewed transaction behavior. Track the upstream SDK and reassess on a reviewed release.
- Cloud deployment, creation/backfill of `wechat_bindings`, removal of the legacy `users.openid` unique index, real transaction-conflict behavior, and simulator acceptance are unverified.
- Task 5 simulator acceptance in WeChat DevTools is unverified.
- Task 6 WeChat DevTools compilation, navigation, rendering, and ordinary-user manual-route smoke acceptance are unverified.
- Enterprise WeChat production identifiers and secret remain intentionally unavailable; strong-message delivery is deferred.

## Next actions

1. Have the controller re-review Task 6 formal-review fix round one and commit only its explicit client, test, and memory paths when no Important findings remain.
2. Execute Task 7: deployment/migration runbook, including binding backfill, guard initialization, recovery hash configuration, and dependency-risk note.
3. Run Task 8 manual WeChat DevTools deployment and simulator/database acceptance for the exact commit.
4. Continue the approved templates, SLA/calendar, evidence/video, reminder, and Enterprise WeChat adapter phases.
