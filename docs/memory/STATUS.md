# Current Status

Status captured: 2026-08-07 (Asia/Shanghai)

## Verified state

- Feature branch `codex/account-admin` implements the locally verifiable account-administration milestone through Task 7, including reviewed UI fixes at `cdf2977` and the reviewed deployment/runbook closeout at `7feac41`.
- The guarded first-super-administrator Mini Program flow is implemented through `a1db212`, `62b8cdf`, and `9b8b034`: the account service exposes initialization, the login page gates the entry, and the dedicated page rechecks server state, submits credentials from the trusted Mini Program runtime, clears sensitive fields, and hands successful initialization to forced password change.
- CloudBase fixed-document reads now normalize only explicit missing-document failures to `null` through `0f16140` and the reviewed boundary correction at `5fc1957`; collection, permission, network, timeout, and other database failures still propagate. The test database now reproduces the real SDK behavior instead of returning a synthetic null record.
- Implemented: password hashing, account/password authentication, first-login password change, lockout, emergency initialization/recovery, super-administrator user lifecycle, last-active-admin protection, CloudBase repositories, protected routes, deterministic WeChat identity reservations, and audit-safe logging.
- Mini Program account flow now includes silent account service calls with preserved backend error codes, session restoration, initialization gating, memory-only first-login challenge handoff, forced and normal password change, app-owned auth reset, and a dashboard guard without legacy profile bootstrapping.
- The Mini Program now includes protected super-administrator user listing, creation, editing, status changes, password reset, unlock, WeChat unbind, last-active-administrator messaging, gated dashboard entry, and profile password/logout controls. Password values stay out of global state, storage, datasets, and navigation parameters.
- CloudBase account state uses a singleton `system_settings/account_admin_state` guard so all active-super-admin transitions contend on one document.
- WeChat identity uniqueness uses `wechat_bindings/<sha256(openid)>`; it does not rely on an unsupported sparse unique `users.openid` index.
- Credential mutations use monotonic `credentialVersion`; challenge invalidation uses strict monotonic `challengeEpoch`. Both fail closed on corrupt or overflowing state.
- `wx-server-sdk` is pinned and locked at `4.0.2`.
- Task 7 adds `docs/deployment/account-admin-setup.md` and README guidance for collection/index setup, guarded migration order, initial administrator setup, recovery rotation, and local verification. It documents the implemented `INVALID_RECOVERY_CODE` result for consumed or mismatched recovery state rather than the stale-plan `RECOVERY_CODE_USED` value. Formal-review round one adds an explicit post-index-removal rollback sequence and a password-manager-only recovery-hash workflow.

## Verification

Executed on 2026-08-07 for the CloudBase missing-document fix at `0f16140` and reviewed boundary correction at `5fc1957`:

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| Focused regression test before the production fix | RED as expected: 1 failure with the explicit CloudBase missing-document error. |
| Focused regression test after the production fix | GREEN: 1 test, 0 failures; a non-missing permission failure remained visible. |
| Collection-error boundary RED/GREEN | RED reproduced an incorrectly swallowed collection error; GREEN preserved collection, permission, network, and timeout failures while supporting structured and text-form document-not-found results. |
| Repository and account-route tests | Passed: 44 tests, 0 failures. |
| `npm.cmd test --prefix cloudfunctions/businessApi` | Passed: 121 tests, 0 failures. |
| `node --test miniprogram/test/account-flow.test.js miniprogram/test/admin-users-flow.test.js` | Passed: 43 tests, 0 failures. |
| `node tools/test-wxml-structure.mjs` | Passed: 1 test, 0 failures. |
| JavaScript syntax, `git diff --check`, and project-memory validation | Passed. |
| Independent review after boundary correction | Passed: no remaining Critical or Important findings. |

Uploading the updated `businessApi`, recompiling the Mini Program, and confirming the initialization entry in the real CloudBase environment remain unverified.

Executed on 2026-08-07 for the guarded initialization-page implementation at `9b8b034` plus the documentation closeout working tree:

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm.cmd test --prefix cloudfunctions/businessApi` | Passed: 120 tests, 0 failures. |
| `node --test miniprogram/test/account-flow.test.js miniprogram/test/admin-users-flow.test.js` | Passed: 43 tests, 0 failures. |
| `node tools/test-wxml-structure.mjs` | Passed: 1 test, 0 failures. |
| JavaScript syntax checks for the account service, login page, and initialization page | Passed. |
| `git diff --check` | Passed (line-ending warnings only). |
| Sensitive-fixture scan outside tests and the implementation plan | Passed: no matches. |
| Project-memory validator | Passed. |
| Independent implementation and staged-candidate review | Passed after date correction: no remaining Critical or Important findings. |

CloudBase initialization, automatic-login handoff, forced password change, and redacted post-initialization database checks remain unverified manual acceptance items.

Executed on 2026-08-06 for commit `db8dbf3`:

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm.cmd ci --ignore-scripts` | Passed; installed the locked 4.0.2 SDK tree. |
| `npm.cmd test --prefix cloudfunctions/businessApi` | Passed: 120 tests, 0 failures. |
| `node tools/test-wxml-structure.mjs` | Passed: 1 test, 0 failures. |
| JavaScript syntax checks | Passed. |
| `git diff --check` | Passed. |
| Independent formal review | READY; no remaining Critical, Important, or Minor code findings. |

Executed on 2026-08-06 for Task 7 completed at `7feac41`:

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm.cmd ci --ignore-scripts --prefix cloudfunctions/businessApi` | Unverified: local npm cache/filesystem returned `EPERM`; no dependency or source change was made. |
| `npm.cmd test --prefix cloudfunctions/businessApi` | Passed: 120 tests, 0 failures. |
| `node --test miniprogram/test/account-flow.test.js miniprogram/test/admin-users-flow.test.js` | Passed: 30 tests, 0 failures. |
| `node tools/test-wxml-structure.mjs` | Passed: 1 test, 0 failures. |
| `git diff --check` | Passed (line-ending warnings only). |

Cloud deployment, database migration, index creation, recovery configuration, and WeChat DevTools operator acceptance remain unverified until executed against the exact commit in the target environment.

Formal-review round one for Task 7 reran `git diff --check` and the project-memory validator after documentation-only corrections; both passed. Source and client test suites were not rerun because the review changed neither code nor verification commands.

## Blockers

- `npm audit` reports six transitive findings (one moderate, five high) through the official `wx-server-sdk@4.0.2` dependency tree. npm proposes a major downgrade to 2.5.3; it was not applied because it would invalidate the reviewed transaction behavior. Track the upstream SDK and reassess on a reviewed release.
- The guarded Mini Program initialization page and missing-document correction are locally implemented. The updated cloud function still requires deployment; real CloudBase initialization, automatic forced-password-change handoff, and redacted database-state checks remain unverified until operator acceptance is completed against the exact deployed commit.
- Cloud deployment, creation/backfill of `wechat_bindings`, removal of the legacy `users.openid` unique index, real transaction-conflict behavior, and simulator acceptance are unverified.
- Task 5 simulator acceptance in WeChat DevTools is unverified.
- Task 6 WeChat DevTools compilation, navigation, rendering, and ordinary-user manual-route smoke acceptance are unverified.
- Enterprise WeChat production identifiers and secret remain intentionally unavailable; strong-message delivery is deferred.

## Next actions

1. Upload and deploy the updated `businessApi` with cloud-installed dependencies, recompile the imported `account-admin` project, and confirm the initialization entry appears without a missing-binding error.
2. Verify only redacted post-initialization database state and account lifecycle outcomes; never place operator credentials, identity values, recovery material, or hashes in Git.
3. After Task 8 passes, complete the branch integration decision.
4. Continue the approved templates, SLA/calendar, evidence/video, reminder, and Enterprise WeChat adapter phases.
