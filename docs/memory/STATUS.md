# Current Status

Status captured: 2026-08-06 (Asia/Shanghai)

## Verified state

- Feature branch `codex/account-admin` implements the account-administration milestone through Task 6, including formal-review fixes at `cdf2977`.
- Implemented: password hashing, account/password authentication, first-login password change, lockout, emergency initialization/recovery, super-administrator user lifecycle, last-active-admin protection, CloudBase repositories, protected routes, deterministic WeChat identity reservations, and audit-safe logging.
- Mini Program account flow now includes silent account service calls with preserved backend error codes, session restoration, initialization gating, memory-only first-login challenge handoff, forced and normal password change, app-owned auth reset, and a dashboard guard without legacy profile bootstrapping.
- The Mini Program now includes protected super-administrator user listing, creation, editing, status changes, password reset, unlock, WeChat unbind, last-active-administrator messaging, gated dashboard entry, and profile password/logout controls. Password values stay out of global state, storage, datasets, and navigation parameters.
- CloudBase account state uses a singleton `system_settings/account_admin_state` guard so all active-super-admin transitions contend on one document.
- WeChat identity uniqueness uses `wechat_bindings/<sha256(openid)>`; it does not rely on an unsupported sparse unique `users.openid` index.
- Credential mutations use monotonic `credentialVersion`; challenge invalidation uses strict monotonic `challengeEpoch`. Both fail closed on corrupt or overflowing state.
- `wx-server-sdk` is pinned and locked at `4.0.2`.
- Task 7 adds `docs/deployment/account-admin-setup.md` and README guidance for collection/index setup, guarded migration order, initial administrator setup, recovery rotation, and local verification. It documents the implemented `INVALID_RECOVERY_CODE` result for consumed or mismatched recovery state rather than the stale-plan `RECOVERY_CODE_USED` value. Formal-review round one adds an explicit post-index-removal rollback sequence and a password-manager-only recovery-hash workflow.

## Verification

Executed on 2026-08-06 for commit `db8dbf3`:

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm.cmd ci --ignore-scripts` | Passed; installed the locked 4.0.2 SDK tree. |
| `npm.cmd test --prefix cloudfunctions/businessApi` | Passed: 120 tests, 0 failures. |
| `node tools/test-wxml-structure.mjs` | Passed: 1 test, 0 failures. |
| JavaScript syntax checks | Passed. |
| `git diff --check` | Passed. |
| Independent formal review | READY; no remaining Critical, Important, or Minor code findings. |

Executed on 2026-08-06 for the current Task 7 documentation changes:

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm.cmd ci --ignore-scripts --prefix cloudfunctions/businessApi` | Unverified: local npm cache/filesystem returned `EPERM`; no dependency or source change was made. |
| `npm.cmd test --prefix cloudfunctions/businessApi` | Passed: 120 tests, 0 failures. |
| `node --test miniprogram/test/account-flow.test.js miniprogram/test/admin-users-flow.test.js` | Passed: 30 tests, 0 failures. |
| `node tools/test-wxml-structure.mjs` | Passed: 1 test, 0 failures. |
| `git diff --check` | Passed (line-ending warnings only). |

Cloud deployment, database migration, index creation, recovery configuration, and WeChat DevTools operator acceptance remain unverified until executed against the exact commit in the target environment.

Formal-review round one for Task 7 reran `git diff --check` and the project-memory validator after documentation-only corrections; both passed. Source and client test suites were not rerun because the review changed neither code nor verification commands.

Executed on 2026-08-06 in the Task 5 worktree based on `9ed0422`:

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `node --test miniprogram/test/account-flow.test.js` | Passed: 14 tests, 0 failures. |
| `node tools/test-wxml-structure.mjs` | Passed: 1 test, 0 failures. |
| `npm.cmd test --prefix cloudfunctions/businessApi` | Passed: 120 tests, 0 failures. |
| JavaScript syntax checks for changed client files | Passed. |

Executed on 2026-08-06 in the Task 6 worktree based on `d1482c8`:

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `node --test miniprogram/test/account-flow.test.js miniprogram/test/admin-users-flow.test.js` | Passed: 26 tests, 0 failures. |
| `node tools/test-wxml-structure.mjs` | Passed: 1 test, 0 failures. |
| `npm.cmd test --prefix cloudfunctions/businessApi` | Passed: 120 tests, 0 failures. |
| JavaScript syntax checks for the Task 6 service, pages, and focused test | Passed. |
| `git diff --check` | Passed. |

Executed on 2026-08-06 for Task 6 formal-review fix round one based on `345a972`:

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `node --test miniprogram/test/account-flow.test.js miniprogram/test/admin-users-flow.test.js` | Passed: 30 tests, 0 failures. |
| `node tools/test-wxml-structure.mjs` | Passed: 1 test, 0 failures. |
| `npm.cmd test --prefix cloudfunctions/businessApi` | Passed: 120 tests, 0 failures. |
| JavaScript syntax checks for the changed administrator pages and focused test | Passed. |
| `git diff --check` | Passed. |

## Blockers

- `npm audit` reports six transitive findings (one moderate, five high) through the official `wx-server-sdk@4.0.2` dependency tree. npm proposes a major downgrade to 2.5.3; it was not applied because it would invalidate the reviewed transaction behavior. Track the upstream SDK and reassess on a reviewed release.
- Cloud deployment, creation/backfill of `wechat_bindings`, removal of the legacy `users.openid` unique index, real transaction-conflict behavior, and simulator acceptance are unverified.
- Task 5 simulator acceptance in WeChat DevTools is unverified.
- Task 6 WeChat DevTools compilation, navigation, rendering, and ordinary-user manual-route smoke acceptance are unverified.
- Enterprise WeChat production identifiers and secret remain intentionally unavailable; strong-message delivery is deferred.

## Next actions

1. Review and commit Task 7's explicit documentation and memory paths after its local verification is recorded.
2. Run Task 8 manual WeChat DevTools deployment, simulator, migration, index, and database acceptance for the exact commit.
3. Continue the approved templates, SLA/calendar, evidence/video, reminder, and Enterprise WeChat adapter phases.
